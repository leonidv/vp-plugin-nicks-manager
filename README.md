# Nicknames manager (Visual Paradigm plugin)
## What is it
Visual Paradigm's plugin which allows swap nicknames. Sometimes we make a mistake and

Original namespace, but really it was another. Manual transfer is boring and requires many-many mouse operations. 
This plugin can fix error in 3 clicks.
